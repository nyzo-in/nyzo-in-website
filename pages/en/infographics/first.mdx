  ## NYZO ![NYZO](/images/nyzo-logo--white.svg?raw=true&sanitize=true "NYZO")

  Highly efficient proof-of-diversity blockchain

  NYZO has been developed from the ground up, it is an open-source initiative and isn’t a copy of any existing blockchain project.

  The network has been running succefully and the source code can be found on GitHub. The NYZO codebase is going to start acting 
  as an API server. This will be run-mode dependent, just like the various web server functions that are available now. 
  It will interact with the mesh on one side and whatever it needs to interact with on the other side.

  ### Proof-of-diversity (POD)

  Proof-of-Diversity (PoD) consensus mechanism requires active participation in the form of time and verifier behaviour 
  in the blockchain to be allowed to exert a certain influence on the system as a whole. 
  The Proof-of-Diversity blockchain uses verification cycles to establish the authoritative form of the blockchain. 
  The basic concept of proof-of-diversity is simple. Verifiers take turns producing blocks in a circular order. 
  Some simple rules ensure that verifiers are neither added to nor removed from that circular order too quickly. 
  In order to produce a believable forgery of the blockchain for any meaningful amount of time, 
  an attacker would need to obtain more than half of the private keys of verifiers currently working on the blockchain. 
  The design and technology are simple and clearly explained in NYZO whitepaper.

  ### Verifier

  Mesh (cycle) participants are called verifiers. Verifiers are in charge of verifying transactions and producing blocks. 
  In exchange for securing the network, verifiers collect transaction fees which are distributed fairly among all of them. 
  Each verifier gets a chance to verify one block in one mesh cycle. 
  NYZO don’t need mining equipment and large amounts of processing power like others, only unique IP address and always on Linux VPS is required.

  ### Sentinel 

  The purpose of the NYZO Sentinel is to provide improve stability of the cycle by producing blocks for in-cycle verifiers 
  that are unable to produce blocks due to temporary hardware and network issues. 
  The Sentinel should not be run on an instance that is running the verifier. 
  The NYZO sentinel is a seperate version of the nyzoVerifier designed to protect your in-cycle verifiers. 
  Its job is to constantly check up on your verifiers. 
  If one of them is unresponsive, the sentinel will initiate communication on behalf of the verifier, 
  this all to ensure future cycle inclusion.

  ### The Mesh (cycle)

  Is simply a network of computers known as verifiers all running NYZO and communicating information to each other. 
  The Mesh (cycle) is a central point of PoD system. 
  For securing the Mesh these computers are given 10% reward of transaction fees for each block they secure.

  ### Block files

  One part of the consensus algorithm is the block consolidation process which ensures that a small machine 
  such as a Rock64 Pro or a beefy Raspberry Pi can run a NYZO verifier with little storage space. 
  1000 blocks are consolidated into 500 Kb of storage space. Very efficient.

  ### 51% attack resistance and energy efficiency

  NYZO has a properly designed economic model that relies on time. 
  Therefore, the cost for 51% attacks (relative to market cap) is huge, there is ongoing incentive to participate in the network, 
  and attacks based on computing power (PoW) or ownership of token (PoS) aren’t feasible. 
  NYZO uses only a tiny fraction of Bitcoin’s resources while performing the same tasks. 
  58 000 000 000 kwH - 58 TWh : current BTC power cons. per year 
  vs 36500 kwH - 0.0000365 TWh : current NYZO power cons. per year = 1,589,041 times more efficient and 51% attack resistant.

  ### Roadmap

  NYZO developers have been asked many times for a roadmap. 
  The roadmap is to keep making the code more stable, more robust, and more efficient.

  ### Scalability

  NYZO doesn’t require any Layer 2 scaling solutions and is able to handle high transaction volumes per 
  second which is only dependent on the performance of the verifiers in the mesh. 
  The block time is 7 seconds and block size is 28 Kb.
  NYZO provides deterministic finality within 8.5 seconds, plus or minus a few.
