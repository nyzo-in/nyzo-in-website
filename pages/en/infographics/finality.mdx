  ## Finality

  TRANSACTION FINALITY
  
  THE PROPERTY THAT ONCE A TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED, THERE IS NO WAY TO REVERT IT (OR ALTER IT), 
  IT'S THE MOMENT WHEN THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE TRANSFER CAN CONSIDER THE DEAL DONE. 
  FINALITY CAN BE DETERMINISTIC OR PROBABILISTIC 
  
  FOR LARGE MONEY TRANSFERS, THE RECEIVER OF THE FUNDS WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO WAIT 
  FOR THE TRANSACTION TO BECOME IRREVERSIBLE. OR AT LEAST, ENOUGH TIME SHOULD PASS UNTIL A 
  PROBABILISTIC FINALITY IS REACHED. IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY, INSTITUTIONS NEED TO KNOW, 
  PREFERABLY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, WHETHER THEY TRULY OWN CERTAIN ASSETS. 
  
  THE BITCOIN PROTOCOL IS DESIGNED SUCH THAT A NEW BLOCK IS ADDED ROUGHLY EVERY 10 MINUTES.
  WHEN A NEW TRANSACTION IS CREATED, THERE'S NO WAY TO CONFIRM IT UNTIL IT IS INCLUDED IN A BLOCK. 
  REGARDING FINALITY, MOST BLOCKCHAIN BASED PROTOCOLS (INCLUDING BITCOIN) DO NOT HAVE A DETERMINISTIC FINALITY. 
  FOR ANY GIVEN BLOCK, THERE IS A THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY THAT A LONGER CHAIN THAT STARTS BEFORE THAT 
  BLOCK WILL BE PROPAGATED THROUGH THE NETWORK. 
  IN PRACTICE THOUGH, THERE IS A VERY SIMPLE WAY OF PROBABILISTICALLY CONSIDERING A TRANSACTION TO BE FINAL: 
  JUST WAIT FOR 6 CONFIRMATION BLOCKS. 
  
  NANO USES A NEW APPROACH TO MAINTAIN A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER - BLOCK-LATTICE. 
  A TRANSFER OF MONEY INVOLVES THE CREATION OF TWO TRANSACTIONS: ONE FOR THE SENDER'S ACCOUNT AND ANOTHER ONE FOR THE RECEIVER'S ACCOUNT. 
  THE TRANSFER IS COMPLETED ONLY WHEN BOTH TRANSACTIONS ARE ACKNOWLEDGED AND ACCEPTED BY THE NETWORK. 
  BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXPLICIT VOTING FOR A TRANSACTION, NANO DOESN'T HAVE ANY KIND OF FINALITY SYSTEM IN PLACE. 
  THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING THE NETWORK TO MODIFY ACCOUNT CHAINS ANY TIME USING THEIR VOTING POWER. 
  
  DETERMINISTIC FINALITY OCCURS AND A TRANSACTION IS CONSIDERED TO BE FINAL IMMEDIATELY ONCE IT IS ADDED TO THE BLOCKCHAIN. 
  NYZO PROVIDES DETERMINISTIC FINALITY WITHIN 8.5 SECONDS CURRENTLY AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO WORK EVEN FASTER.
