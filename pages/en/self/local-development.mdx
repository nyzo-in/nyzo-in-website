There are two ways to start the project locally.

## With docker

The simplest is probably with docker

At a command line, `cd` to the project directory and run `docker-compose up`

## With nodejs and npm

Alternatively, if you have nodejs and npm installed locally you can 

`cd` to the project directory and run `npm run dev`

## What can I do once I have the project running locally.

The next steps could be:

- Familiarise yourself with [the project structure](the-project-structure).
- [Contribute new content](contribute-content), guides, articles, thoughts, proposals. etc.
- Help others access the existing information by [translating existing content](translations) to your language.
- If you prefer to [contribute to the website codebase](contribute-code), implementing feature requests and bug fixes etc. is appreciated.

## Issues running the nyzo.in locally?

### Docker

If you're using docker, make sure docker and docker-compose are installed. Check with: 

`docker -v` & `docker-compose -v` from a command line. 
If these commands don't tell you what version you are using, then re-view your install process.

### node.js & npm

Similarly you're using node.js and npm ensure they're installed. Check with: 

`node -v` & `npm -v` from a command line. 
Re-view your install process if these don't return version numbers, or show version numbers that are out of date for this project.

node.js version greater than 10 is recommended
