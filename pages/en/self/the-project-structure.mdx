## Overview

What is on this page? It's a description of the folders and files for this website.

If you're interested in contributing content and/or translations to the project then all you need to know about is: Pages, Components and Public.

Otherwise, if you want to contribute code to the project, then all of it is relevant.

## Pages

This is where content is written. You will see:

1. Folders for each language. 
1. Sub folders for content categories.
1. *.mdx files. These are (enhanced) MarkDown files for written content.
1. Content editors can ignore the "system files": _app.js, _document.js, _error.js, index.jsx

Have a look in: `pages/en/self/the-project-structure.mdx`, it's where this content (that you're reading now) is typed.

```
ğŸ“‚pages
 â”£ ğŸ“‚en
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚guides
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œintro.mdx
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚self
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œcontribute-code.mdx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œcontribute-content.mdx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œlocal-development.mdx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œthe-project-structure.mdx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œtranslations.mdx
 â”£ ğŸš·_app.js
 â”£ ğŸš·_document.js
 â”£ ğŸš·_error.js
 â”— ğŸš·index.jsx
```

## Components

The website is built of many components. These are all located in the components folder. This structure is helpful because a component can be written once and re-used many times.

When a component has styles, a folder is created to contain both.

Components do not have language content inside them, it is imported from locales. 

```
ğŸ“¦components
 â”£ ğŸ“‚header
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œHeader.jsx
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œstyles.js
 â”£ ğŸ“œFooter.jsx
 â”£ ğŸ“œLanguageSelect.jsx
 â”£ ğŸ“œMesh.jsx
 â”— ğŸ“œPage.jsx
```

## Public

1. Here, each language has a folder. and inside it are *.json files. These contain the words/content for components.
2. Assets like images are also saved here.

```
ğŸ“¦public
 â”— ğŸ“‚locales
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚de
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œcommon.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œfooter.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œmesh.json
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚en
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œcommon.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œfooter.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œmesh.json
 â”— ğŸ“‚images
 ```

## i18n.js

You'll need to edit this file if you're adding a new language.

```
ğŸ“¦lib
 â”£ ğŸ“œi18n.js
```

Content writers and translators, you're done with this page now (if you like). The rest of it is more relevant to coders.

## The other stuff

## Docker

These are the related to docker. The idea is that docker provides us with a consistent environment for local development across various different machines.

It is normally not necessary to edit these files.

```
ğŸ“¦nyzo-in-website
 â”£ ğŸ“‚docker
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚web
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œDockerfile
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œdocker-entrypoint.sh
 â”£ ğŸ“œdocker-compose.yml
 ```

 ## Layouts

 At the start of each *.mdx (in the frontMatter) you'll see a layout is defined like: `layout: 'docs-page'`.

 In the layouts folder are *.jsx components for rendering the *.mdx pages.

 ```
 ğŸ“¦nyzo-in-website
 â”£ ğŸ“‚layouts
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œdocs-page.jsx
 ```

 ## Library

The lib folder is where files that are used through the project belong. These files will usually contain and export a function or functions.

Each file and functions should be documented with comments.

 ```
ğŸ“¦nyzo-in-website
 â”£ ğŸ“‚lib
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œi18n.js
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œutils.js
 ```
